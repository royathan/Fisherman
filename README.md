# Fisherman ðŸŽ£

Fisherman is a lightweight, user-friendly GUI application for managing Docker containers. Built with Go and the Fyne toolkit, it provides a simple interface to monitor and control your Docker containers in real-time.

This is largely a test of using Cursor to write a quick GUI application (and test out Fyne capabilities).

## Prerequisites

## Installation

1. Install Go if you haven't already: https://golang.org/doc/install

```bash
brew install go
```

2. Run the application

```
